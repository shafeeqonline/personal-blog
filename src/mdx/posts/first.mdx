Write your blog posts in [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/). With MDX, you can use components directly in markdown.

<Box sx={{p:4, textAlign: "center", bg: "secondary", color: "white", mb: 4 }}>I’m a Box component</Box>

Testing Syntax highlighting with [Prism React Renderer](https://github.com/FormidableLabs/prism-react-renderer).

```jsx
<Box>I’m a Box component</Box>
```
